# 2026-09 performance program

Measurements from the 7 to 8 September 2026 performance pass on the `squirrel`
CLI, the audit engine and the hosted runtime. Everything here was measured, on
the machines and fixtures stated, and each row links the change that produced
it. The CLI runs on Bun 1.4 since v0.0.91.

Machine for the CLI rows unless stated: 16 GB Apple Silicon laptop under heavy
memory pressure (other work running, swap in use), so single wall-clock values
carry noise; the shapes, ratios and controlled pairs are the trustworthy part.
Fixture: the synthetic estate in [`harness/`](./harness/) built around a real
982 KB script-heavy product page (10%), a stripped 159 KB variant (10%), and
20 KB documentation, blog, listing and thin pages (80%), mean 128 KB per page.

## Headline: a 2,500-page audit on one machine

CLI audit, `--coverage full`, cold, fresh content store per stage, interleaved
old/new runs, `heapUsed` sampled after a forced collection at exit. Before is the
resident pipeline (every page held in memory through the rules pass); after is
the streaming pipeline ([#252](https://github.com/squirrelscan/squirrelscan/pull/252)).

| pages | wall before | wall after | heap before | heap after |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 400 | 47 s | 47 s | 685 MB | 265 MB |
| 1,000 | 194 s | 128 s | 1,662 MB | 565 MB |
| 2,500 | 502 s | 177 s | 3,902 MB | 996 MB |
| 1,000, warm re-audit | 87 s | 72 s | 1,651 MB | 561 MB |

Reports are byte-identical at all three sizes (at 2,500 pages excluding
`perf/ttfb`, which grades the test server's response time and tripped on 14
pages while the resident run was starving it). Wall time improved rather than
paying the parse-per-batch cost, because a multi-gigabyte heap costs more in
collector and compressor work than the extra parse.

## The cold crawl against a filled cache

`ContentStore.put()` called `getStats()`, a `COUNT + SUM` over the whole global
content store, once per stored page. On a 947 MB store that scan was 90.2% of a
cold audit's CPU (339 s of 376 s in a CPU profile), and a store that had grown
past its 900 MB prune threshold paid it twice per page, forever. Fixed with one
covering index ([#246](https://github.com/squirrelscan/squirrelscan/pull/246)).

| measurement | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| `getStats()` on a 947 MB store | 295 ms | 1.3 ms |
| storing 60 pages into a 93 MB store | 32.4 ms/page | 0.38 ms/page |
| 400-page cold crawl, 992 MB store | 333 s (833 ms/page) | see next row |
| 1,000-page cold crawl, 947 MB store | | 26 s (26 ms/page) |
| 1,000-page warm crawl, same store | | 15 s (15 ms/page) |

Controlled triple that located it (400 identical pages, identical rules time):
992 MB store 333 s, empty store 5 s, pages already stored 4 s.

## Retention per page in the engine

Measured on 150 real 959 KB pages with per-page-distinct assets, as string
backing store (`process.memoryUsage().external`) above a retain-nothing control,
batch of 50. Each of these was a string sliced from a page's HTML and kept past
the page's lifetime, which in JavaScriptCore pins the whole page as UTF-16.

| structure | before | after | change |
|---|---|---|---|
| page rule results attached to their page | 4,020 KB/page | 213 KB/page | [#234](https://github.com/squirrelscan/squirrelscan/pull/234) |
| streamed universe without stored parse | 3,900 KB/page | 77 KB/page | [#237](https://github.com/squirrelscan/squirrelscan/pull/237) |
| external-link occurrences (map keys) | 1,870 KB/page | 0 | [#240](https://github.com/squirrelscan/squirrelscan/pull/240) |
| hosted prefetch payload excerpts | 7,800 KB/page | 130 KB/page | [#255](https://github.com/squirrelscan/squirrelscan/pull/255) |
| site-query link scan (`SELECT *` over pages) | +431 MB RSS across the call | +88 MB | [#236](https://github.com/squirrelscan/squirrelscan/pull/236) |

Remaining per-page term after these: about 80 KB of real values the site pass
reads, flat across 50 / 100 / 150 pages.

## Hosted runtime, in production

Same 149-page rendered audit of the same site an hour apart, old image against
new (#234, #236, #237), RSS in MB from the run's phase events:

| phase | old image | new image |
|---|---|---|
| page rules growth, post-GC | +869 | +382 |
| site-query step | +350 | -18 |
| resident at end of rules | 1,233 | 795 |
| peak in the rules phase | 1,581 | 1,180 |

Findings unchanged (score 47 both runs).

## Streaming batch budget

`SQUIRREL_STREAM_BATCH_BYTES` (default 48 MB) sets how much raw HTML is parsed
at once. Measured with the OS high-water mark on 150 real 959 KB pages
([#245](https://github.com/squirrelscan/squirrelscan/pull/245)):

| budget | pages per batch | peak RSS |
|---|---|---|
| 6 MB | 6 | 480 MB |
| 12 MB | 12 | 344 MB |
| 24 MB | 25 | 492 MB |
| 48 MB | 51 | 509 MB |
| 96 MB | 102 | 655 MB |

No budget gets under about 357 MB (rule set, runner, SQLite caches, allocator
floor); an 8.5x larger batch gives a 1.9x larger peak; and below about 12 pages
per batch a smaller budget is worse, because the extra read/parse/collect cycles
set the high-water mark.

## Hosted crawl reuse

A second hosted audit of an unchanged 150-page site on the old code: crawl
433 s then 482 s (the re-run was slower), one render-cache hit out of about 140
renders. Cross-run reuse of the previous audit's pages
(squirrelscan/repo#1902) and a source fingerprint that survives Shopify's
cache-entry regeneration ([#242](https://github.com/squirrelscan/squirrelscan/pull/242),
[#244](https://github.com/squirrelscan/squirrelscan/pull/244)) are deployed;
the measured pair will be added here when it completes.

## Fixed along the way

- Seed-redirect probe sent no user agent; a WAF's 403 was read as "no
  redirect", the crawl pinned to the apex and dropped every `www.` link as
  cross-domain, producing silent one-page audits at full price
  ([#248](https://github.com/squirrelscan/squirrelscan/pull/248),
  [#249](https://github.com/squirrelscan/squirrelscan/pull/249)).
- `bun:sqlite` returns `null` for a missing row; an existence check tested
  against `undefined` and was always true
  ([#247](https://github.com/squirrelscan/squirrelscan/pull/247)).
- Bun 1.4 (v0.0.91): Linux binaries 11 to 14% smaller, ~10 ms faster start,
  byte-identical audit results.

## Reading a crawl's checks once instead of twice

The report path called `getRuleResultsByPage` and then `getRuleResultsByRuleId`.
The two queries differ only in their `ORDER BY`, and each built its own
`CheckResult` per row, so every check was read and materialized twice. At 1,000
pages that is 203,687 rows, 204 per page, for 11.3 MB of stored text.

Measured in isolation on that crawl, alternating the two arms twice, growth
across the call with a forced collection at each end
([#258](https://github.com/squirrelscan/squirrelscan/pull/258)):

| arm | RSS | external | wall |
|---|---|---|---|
| two reads | +341 to +368 MB | +40 MB | 542-890 ms |
| one materialization | +202 to +206 MB | +20 MB | 424-536 ms |

`heapUsed` moved by under 10 MB either way, which is the point worth recording:
the cost of the duplicate is allocator residency and string backing store, not
JS heap objects, so the metric most people reach for cannot see it. Same class
as the `SELECT *` link scan above.

The rows are materialized once and the ORDER is then asked for twice, with the
same `ORDER BY` each original reader used, reading only the row id and the
grouping key. Deriving the order instead — reading once in `id` order and
grouping — measured faster still, and was wrong: it relied on tied `ORDER BY`
rows coming back in `id` order, which held on today's schema but flips under an
index on `(crawl_id, rule_id, page_url)`, changing the emitted issue order.
SQLite leaves tied rows unordered by contract.

End to end the change is real but below the noise floor of an exit measurement.
Reports are byte-identical at 400 and 2,500 pages, and wall time and peak RSS
are unchanged within run-to-run spread.

### What exit `heapUsed` can and cannot resolve

Four 2,500-page runs, two per side of the same change, on the machine described
at the top:

| run | exit heapUsed |
|---|---|
| before, run 1 | 599 MB |
| before, run 2 | 965 MB |
| after, run 1 | 1,144 MB |
| after, run 2 | 998 MB |

The spread within one side is larger than the difference between sides, so this
metric cannot judge a change of this size at 2,500 pages. It stays trustworthy
for the large gaps above (the streaming change was 3,902 MB against 996 MB, a
factor of four), and those figures should be read as the shape rather than to
three digits. For a change worth tens or low hundreds of megabytes, measure the
call in isolation against a retain-nothing control instead.

## Still open

- Site rules are quadratic in page count (4 s at 400 pages, 99 s at 2,500,
  687 s at 5,000): squirrelscan/repo#1910.
- Report reconstruction materializes every check, including the 83.7% that
  pass and never reach the report: squirrelscan/repo#1920. Reading them once
  rather than twice is done (above); dropping the passing rows needs a decision
  about the publish payload first.
- `--max-pages` above 5,000 is silently clamped: squirrelscan/repo#1909.
